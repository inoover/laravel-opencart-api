# laravel-opencart-api

**Why Laravel**

Opencart is a lightweight and good opensource ecommerce, and I love it because of performance and yeah, it's FREE.
However, using opencart is quite limited for further development. I find out that its MVC is really messup and repeatable code. We don't say that OC is bad, but we should find a way to improve this awesome framework.
We need to design pattern to be more easier for developer.

This project will start from RESTful API which will allow developer to extend and plugin other application in both Admin and Catalog.
